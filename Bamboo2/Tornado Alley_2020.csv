These storms moved northeast and affected portions of northeastern Oklahoma during the early morning hours of the 19th. Although instability had decreased ahead of these storms during the night-time hours, wind shear had strengthened significantly as these storms moved into northeast Oklahoma. As a result, one of these storms produced a tornado in Creek County. In addition, some of these thunderstorms moved repeatedly across the same areas, which resulted in locally heavy rainfall that combined with saturated soils, produced flash flooding. Another round of thunderstorms moved across northeastern Oklahoma later that morning. Another tornado developed with these thunderstorms, as well as locally damaging wind and flash flooding.||In addition to the flash flooding and severe weather, these multiple rounds of thunderstorms resulted in widespread heavy rainfall across northeastern Oklahoma. One to three inches fell across much of the area, with a heavier axis of three to six inches. This widespread heavy rainfall resulted in moderate flooding of the Caney and Neosho Rivers, and major flooding of the Illinois River.","This tornado developed south of I-40 and west of the N3760 Road.

Another round of thunderstorms moved across northeastern Oklahoma later that morning. Another tornado developed with these thunderstorms, as well as locally damaging wind and flash flooding.||In addition to the flash flooding and severe weather, these multiple rounds of thunderstorms resulted in widespread heavy rainfall across northeastern Oklahoma.

One of these weak thundershowers managed to spawn a landspout tornado a few miles west of Davenport, NE, in extreme northeastern portions of Nuckolls County. This landspout, unlike most, did cause some damage as nearly a dozen empty coal railroad cars were overturned. The aforementioned line of thunderstorms strengthened slightly during the evening, per radar reflectivity, before weakening with loss of daytime heating around sunset. The landspout was the only known severe weather caused by this line of thunderstorms as the main focus for severe convection remained further south across Kansas near the Interstate 70 corridor.||Showers and thunderstorms blossomed over south central Nebraska and north central Kansas after 10 PM Sunday and continued through the entire overnight. This activity remained non-severe, but very slow storm motions and abundant deep layer moisture allowed for heavy rain rates and, subsequently, pockets of very heavy rainfall. The heaviest rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches (per radar and ground truth observations) appeared to focus across northwest Adams County and southwest Hall County. Numerous county roads became submerged in water and impassable late Sunday night into early Monday morning. The most severe impact, however, was to a residence northwest of Kenesaw as flood water filled the basement and even encroached on the main floor, prompting their rescue early Monday morning. The rescue had to be done via air boat because so many roads in the area were under water and impassable. ||The heavy rain from Sunday night into Monday morning occurred over areas that were already saturated from recent heavy rains from May 21-23, and this likely contributed to the flooding impacts from this event. Very slow storm motions and seasonably high precipitable water values near 1.5��� were also meteorological factors to this heavy rain event. The tornado occurred in conditions fairly typical of landspouts as it was along a surface front with abundant ambient vorticity that was stretched into the vertical axis by steep low level lapse rates and sufficient 0-3 km CAPE near 100 J/kg.","A landspout tornado was confirmed via several eyewitness reports and a damage survey in northern Nuckolls County. This tornado formed along a weak frontal boundary and exhibited the classic landspout characteristics of a long, translucent condensation/dust funnel. The landspout moved southwest along the boundary for over 3 miles. The main damage along its path was the overturning of 11 empty coal railroad cars. Otherwise, damage was minimal.

The hurricane spun slowly but steadily into southern Kenedy and northern Hidalgo County through just after midnight on the 26th, then through Starr County as a Tropical Storm before moving into Tamaulipas before daybreak and eventually near Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, by noon before dissipating during the evening of the 26th. Following the passage of the inner eye wall, broad feeder bands of torrential rains and gusty tropical storm force winds continued through the mid to late morning hours of July 26th, slowly migrating from east to west across the populated Rio Grande Valley. ||Other than storm surge flooding, which peaked just north of Baffin Bay on the Kleberg and Nueces County coast near Corpus Christi, Hanna's memory for the Rio Grande Valley will be flooding rainfall, power outages, and an array of damage to poorly constructed buildings, from minor roof damage to complete demolition.  Between 8 and 15 inches of rain fell from Port Mansfield to Harlingen, and along Interstate Highway 2 out through Mission and Sullivan City. The combination of high rainfall, locally high rainfall rates, and poor drainage left between 18 inches and four feet of water depth in many areas, most commonly from western Cameron through southeastern Hidalgo County, as well as a separate pocket in the Mission/La Joya/Sullivan City area. The rainfall wiped out 95% of the region's cotton crop; the combination of crop loss and production loss was more than one third of a billion dollars alone ($366 million)...most of which was in the Rio Grande Valley region.  ||At the peak of the storm, 250 thousand electric customers were without power, including all of Willacy County. Though storm surge was cut short by strong westerly flow across Cameron County, radiating swells did produce a notable surge of 3 feet or greater (estimated) from near Port Mansfield through Kenedy County. When the damage and economic loss is counted to infrastructure and agriculture combined, it is likely that Hanna cost at least one billion dollars across the Rio Grande Valley and the Deep S. Texas ranch country.","Hurricane Hanna made landfall along the Kenedy county|coast on the evening of July 25, 2020.

Here, an|empty tractor trailer was moved on an angle into a stand of trees, |an unanchored travel trailer was flipped, a storage shed was flattened,|and several mesquite trees lost large limbs. A few minutes later, several |areas of damage occurred on the west side of the Brownsville airport. |A dozen windows were blown out of an airplane hangar building, an|unanchored old jet staircase was flipped and a garage door|collapsed inward. In addition, a Boeing 737 aircraft was moved into a|hangar, causing damage to the hangar wall. No damage was noted to|the plane itself. As the tornado moved to the north northwest,|several large tree limbs were snapped, in addition to a weak|uprooted tree.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset. Finally, it's worth noting that an impressive surface pressure rise/fall couplet of at least 3mb/2hr accompanied the QLCS across the CWA between 05Z and 07Z.","Region 44 Emergency Management assisted with this survey. A brief tornado touched down north of Silver Creek, with a path length of approximately 4 miles and maximum wind gusts estimated to be 85 MPH. Damage was primarily confined to trees, with downed large branches and some uprooted trees. Irrigation pivots along and near the path were overturned. Two farmsteads were affected, one sustained minor damage to a small outbuilding and the other sustained tree damage.",CSV

The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. While an average of two derechos a year occur across the area, a derecho of this intensity is a roughly once-in-a-decade occurrence. Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties. The Cedar Rapids area was particularly hard hit. One fatality occurred in Linn County, as a tree fell on a cyclist. Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph. Wind gusts of 80-100 mph were common as the line of storms moved through the Quad Cities area and then through northwest Illinois. A small pocket of winds estimated at 100-110 mph impacted Princeton, IL in Bureau County, where a 150 foot communications tower collapsed and numerous power poles were snapped. In addition to the damage, numerous long-duration power outages occurred across the region. Damage to crops was considerable along the derecho path. Numerous semi trucks were also blown off roadways along the path of the derecho.","A brief tornado moved through cropland just north of the Eastern Iowa  Airport. The path was found in high resolution satellite imagery. The tornado was on the leading edge of a larger swath of straight line winds that snapped trees and destroyed outbuildings and grain bins.

As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban.

Flooding was not much of an issue, as the storm was progressive enough to keep rainfall amounts largely under one inch. ||Breaking down the meteorological background and event timing, this was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C providing a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding formidable mixed-layer CAPE around 4000 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection. As for what actually transpired, the main show was preceded by a broken line of non-severe, likely elevated storms that passed primarily through counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281 between 12:30-3:30 p.m. CDT. About the time this innocuous early afternoon activity was departing the local area to the southeast, a broken line of true, surface-based storms got going along the front in northeast Nebraska, with the southwestern-most cell building down into the far northeast corner of South Central Nebraska (eastern Nance/northeast Merrick/northern Polk counties) between 3-4 p.m. CDT. Within an hour thereafter, this tail end Charlie storm rapidly grew into a full-blown supercell over Polk/northern York counties, producing its first marginally-severe hail reports. During the following two hours (5-7 p.m. CDT), the storm anchored itself firmly to the surface front, with new updraft generation along its western edge promoting more of a southwestward propagation and causing it to grow larger in both intensity/size, becoming more of a supercell cluster. It was during this time that the brief tornadoes occurred along the storm's far western flank, likely driven by pronounced low-level vorticity stretching along the surface front. While the sporadic tornado touchdowns were brief, the storm continued to be a prolific hail-producer as it gradually exited the local area out of Nuckolls County into northern Kansas between 7-8 p.m. CDT, ending all South Central Nebraska convection for the night.",Crop damage and scouring occurred. The tornado started in Hamilton County and continued into Clay County.,CSV

In addition to dropping three fairly brief EF-0 tornadoes in southeastern Hamilton and northeastern Clay counties, its main calling card was large hail, with several reports of golf ball to slightly larger than baseball size stones in Clay/Nuckolls counties, and smaller hail to around quarter size as far north as Osceola. Interestingly, damaging winds were not a major player, with no ground-truth gusts in excess of 50 MPH. Focusing on specific storm reports, and starting with the three EF-0 tornadoes, they all occurred between 5-6 p.m. CDT, touching down briefly along a roughly 15-mile long corridor from near Interstate 80 a few miles south of Hampton, down to the Saronville area. Per storm surveys, the first two tornadoes were each on the ground for roughly 2 miles.
