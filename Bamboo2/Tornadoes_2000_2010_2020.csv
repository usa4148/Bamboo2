The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. While an average of two derechos a year occur across the area, a derecho of this intensity is a roughly once-in-a-decade occurrence. Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties.

Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph.

A small pocket of winds estimated at 100-110 mph impacted Princeton, IL in Bureau County, where a 150 foot communications tower collapsed and numerous power poles were snapped.

This led to strong baroclinicity along the front, and subsequent convection with just the right amount of instability. This is considered a high shear low CAPE (HSLC) event, where organized severe thunderstorms are favored in this environment. Potential hazards are damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. Six tornadoes were confirmed and several wind reports were received (ranging between 50-60 mph, with a few gusts over 60 mph). Damage reports ranged from structural damage to tree damage. Many residents were left without power in parts of northwestern IL, leading to some schools canceling classes on the 11th. Besides the strong winds, a few severe hail reports were received.||In addition, heavy rain occurred with some of the stronger storms, with rainfall totals over an inch. For how dry it has been, flash flooding was not much of a concern. While the environment was very moist and favorable for heavy rainfall, the fast storm motions led to little accumulation through much of our forecast area.","Brief EF1 tornado touchdown with max winds at 100 mph, a path length of 3.5 miles, and a max path width 100 yards. This tornado touched down northeast of Lyndon, leading to sporadic tree damage, including a few snapped trees, and severe damage to the roof of a large hog building.",CSV
