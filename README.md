# Project 2 - Illinois Tornadoes through the Years

This is Project 3 for Northwestern's Data Science Bootcamp 2021. Our task was to choose an interesting dataset and provide an interactive way for users to explore the data. Using a combination of of a Python Flask - powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, D3, and SQLite, we created a website with three distinct views: the homepage, a map, and chart (edit)

Team Members: Dan Cusick, Michelle Goldberg, and Vaidehee Shah

## Our Data
Years 2000, 2010, and 2020 Tornado Data in Illinois

For our project, we chose to work Tornado Data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) that includes data from 1950 to 2021 for the United States. This dataset is rather large so we decided to work with data specifically from Illinois and compare years 2000, 2010, and 2020. 

After our data was cleaned, we connected it to SQLite.
