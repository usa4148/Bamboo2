# Project 2 - Illinois Tornadoes through the Years

This is Project 3 for Northwestern's Data Science Bootcamp 2021. Our task was to choose an interesting dataset and provide an interactive way for users to explore the data. Using a combination of of a Python Flask - powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, D3, and SQLite, we created a website with three distinct views: the homepage, a map, and chart (edit)

Team Members: Dan Cusick, Michelle Goldberg, and Vaidehee Shah

## The Requirements

The visualization must include a Python Flask - powered API, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript
Powered by a dataset with at least 100 records
Using a SQLite Database
Our Track: A combination of 
We have many user-driven interactions: dropdowns..
Three visualizations: 
Heruko: Used to deploy the final 

## Our Data
Years 2000, 2010, and 2020 Tornado Data in Illinois

For our project, we chose to work Tornado Data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) that includes data from 1950 to 2021 for the United States. This dataset is rather large so we decided to work with data specifically from Illinois and compare years 2000, 2010, and 2020. 

We performed ETL process on the dataset - cleaned the data via Jupyter Lab. This included dropping unnecessary columns, so only tornado data in Illinois would be analyzed. We connected our data to SQLite -- this would have allowd up use SQLAlchemy to call on our data. This could involve using APIs to call upon different datasets to create our visualiztions. 

When creating our dashboard, we created our index.html file first - which would be visulizing our dashboard.
Using Javascript, D3 - we were able to create our visualizations. These were linked and added to main index.html file. This allowed us to launch our dashboard. 



Data Findings:
Montly Tornado Frequency Bar Chart - most tornadoes occured during warmer months of April to July - specifically May and June - tornadoes occur because of warm, moist air


Further Analysis:
Look at damages by year
Size of tornadoes
average magnitude and average total miles of the tornado
fatalities/injuries
density
Tornado Alley
