National Weather Service damage survey teams found the damage from this tornado began just west of 2900 E Road and about one quarter mile south of 1250 N Road, or N 12th Road, which is the road that marks the county line. The tornado crossed north of 1250 N Road at Interstate 39. See Stormdata for Illinois, Central for the beginning of this tornado. ||This tornado continued eastward tracking along and just north of 12th Road,  producing primarily EF0 to EF1 intensity damage, largely in the form of downed trees, power lines, and very minor structural damage. ||After the tornado moved past E 9th Road, the damage became more sporadic, which corresponded with spotter and storm chasers who reported that the tornado was not continuously on the ground before it reached Streator. Damage became more consistent again as the tornado moved east of E 12th Road, remaining just north of N 12th Road. The tornado appears to have remained on the ground from this point east into the city of Streator. The damage from E 9th Road east to E 15th Road was rated EF0 intensity and consisted primarily of minor tree damage.||The tornado appears to have intensified as it moved into the city of Streator with EF2 intensity damage near the Eagle Pass subdivision where there was significant tree damage, along with portions of roofs removed from well built single family homes. The tornado continued eastward across southern portions of the city of Streator, damaging numerous homes and completely destroying several homes. Some of the most intense damage in Streator occurred along Hall Street and near Southside Athletic Park, where damage was rated higher end EF2. The most intense damage occurred through an approximately one quarter mile wide path through the city of Streator.||Twenty one homes were uninhabitable and had to be destroyed. Another 33 homes were uninhabitable and had to undergo major repair. Another 150 homes had some degree of damage.  ||A few businesses were also damaged including the Engle Lane Theater, an auto salvage business, an auto repair shop, and a landscape and nursery business. ||The tornado then continued eastward out of the city of Streator producing additional EF0 to EF1 intensity damage just north of the Livingston and LaSalle county border.
