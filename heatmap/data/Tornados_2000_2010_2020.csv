Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a brief tornado, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southern Illinois during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding.

Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line.

The environment near and south of the front was characterized by dew points in the lower to middle 70's and precipitable water values around 1.75 inches.

The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned.

Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties.

This is considered a high shear low CAPE (HSLC) event, where organized severe thunderstorms are favored in this environment. Potential hazards are damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. Six tornadoes were confirmed and several wind reports were received (ranging between 50-60 mph, with a few gusts over 60 mph). Damage reports ranged from structural damage to tree damage. Many residents were left without power in parts of northwestern IL, leading to some schools canceling classes on the 11th. Besides the strong winds, a few severe hail reports were received.||In addition, heavy rain occurred with some of the stronger storms, with rainfall totals over an inch. For how dry it has been, flash flooding was not much of a concern. While the environment was very moist and favorable for heavy rainfall, the fast storm motions led to little accumulation through much of our forecast area.","Brief EF1 tornado touchdown with max winds at 100 mph, a path length of 3.5 miles, and a max path width 100 yards. This tornado touched down northeast of Lyndon, leading to sporadic tree damage, including a few snapped trees, and severe damage to the roof of a large hog building.",CSV

Light to occasionally moderate freezing rain fell during the afternoon and early evening hours. The heavy precipitation was caused by a strong upper level disturbance that tracked east-northeast from the southern Rockies, across the southern Plains, and then over the lower Mississippi Valley. A strong southerly flow of milder air just above ground level was unable to scour out very cold air right at the surface, which produced an extended period of snow and ice. The liquid equivalent of all the frozen and freezing precipitation was between three quarters of an inch and one inch. Numerous accidents occurred, most of which were minor. The most significant accident was at the junction of Interstates 57 and 64 near Mount Vernon, where a jack-knifed semi-trailer held up traffic for more than an hour.
